      Bridge is a federally-incorporated not-for-profit organization that brings
      together people who believe that we can and should remove barriers
      preventing members of marginalized groups from participating fully and
      equally in the technology industry. We do this by skilling up and
      supporting women, agender, and non-binary professionals via free 11 week
      software development and product design programs. In small classes, and
      through hands-on project-based work, we improve developer’s and designer’s
      skills and greatly increase their confidence.


      Hi Emily!
    title: What is Bridge?
  - body: >-
      We know there are many excellent initiatives you can put your company's
      funds towards to further diversity and inclusion. There's also many online
      sourcing tools, external recruiters, and other methods of finding talent
      out there.




      But what if you could improve your own company's gender diversity, hire a
      talented and hardworking developer, and contribute to making the tech
      community more inclusive overall? Sponsoring Bridge is a cost-effective
      solution to all of these needs. **We make it so that you don't have to
      decide between ROI and the right thing to do.**




      Companies who sponsor Bridge by October 2018 will receive an invitation to
      our Sponsors-only student Meet and Greet in November, among other
      benefits. [Contact us today](mailto:hello@bridgeschool.io) to learn more.

          Interviewing two to five people a week for the last two years has
          exposed me to a lot of different candidates. Bridge candidates stand
          out for their "rubber hits the road" attitude to development, along
          with rich experiences they often bring from other industries. Bridge
          graduates also tend to level up at a higher rate than our average
          developers. Finally, and to me personally one of my favourite things
          about Bridge graduates, is that their work ethic tends to be
          exceptionally strong.
